On my book blog website, users will be able to add books, edit them, or delete them. 
They will also be able to write reviews about these books. 
All data will remain in local-storage. When deleting or editing, it will also be deleted or edited from there. 
Of course, each user will only be able to change or delete the books and reviews they have entered. 
For this, we will also have a login register page. First, users who register will be able to add books, edit them, or delete them. 
This also applies to writing reviews for books. In total, we will have 4 pages. 
index.html - our home page. Book lists and reviews will generally appear here. On the post.html page, books and reviews will be added. 
When you click on the edit button, the post-read.html page will open, where users will also be able to edit or delete their reviews or books here. 
On the login/register page, the user will log in when they first enter the site and will then be able to make changes to the books and reviews they have entered.
